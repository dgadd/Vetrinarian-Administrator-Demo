This source code demonstrates the in-progress development of a Vetrinary Admin web application demo using proper TDD (design-by-test) with a domain model, repository layer (using NHibernate for persistence) and presentation layer clients for both M-V-P pattern (using traditional ASP.NET) and for ASP.NET MVC (now using version 2).

The source code will continue to be updated on a daily/weekly basis.

The deployed demo web application(s) are located at http://www.gaddzeit.com.
